    <strong><u>Fuck My Life</u></strong>
    <p>I spent a hard day bc my boss had gone to Guam for her vacation 6 days ago.
      Every task what she has been doing become my tasks for 6 days during her absence.
      I should check an unanswered call every minute and call back. If someone enters the centers, I have to stop whatever work I am doing, to to the visitor and consult them.
      I don't like this job but I know I should do this if I want to be a manager.
      Finally, I could leave from the center when everything that irritates me was all over! I could stay away from this center fastly and decide to by some alcohol. But I didn't. Bc it's not quite good drinking alcohol when I feel bad. Anyway, I just finished taking a shower. Feeling much better. Now, all I want to do is to install launcher successfully.</p>

    <strong><u>After Work</u></strong>
    <p>My boss has got back to the work. So I can escape from this task!<br>
    I don't have to continue this irritating works. Work is over, but Me and my boss are going to attend a company meeting at 11pm tonight. I think our company is insane. Boss(he is a final boss as fuck) called all supervisors of each branches to 'Guro'. We have no choice. This insane meeting will be started after work. Fuck my life. I'm gonna slay him tonight. (Inner voice tho...) I know it is useless to keep thinking about something can't be changed. Everything happened around me doesn't explain to me that why it had happened. I should five up a few thinks but still it irritates me. The meeting is still ongoing. My boss is talking about the new way to revive to his sinking business. That's none of my business though.<br>
    I made a plan to install Unreal Engine when I arrive my home, after this insane meeting, but now, all is ruined bc it's one o'clock in the morning. I have found a way to install UE4 Engine using Github. Official launcher doesn't work so I have decided to use Github. It's more complicated way, but it can't be helped. Half of install process has finished before the meeting started, and the other half will be completed when I will back to the home. This meeting ruined everything whatever I planned! I'll kill him. Don't stop me. (Inner voice... just go through...)</p>
